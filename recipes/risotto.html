        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This new way with risotto makes an easy supper for two. For a non-veggie option, just add a few cooked, peeled prawns</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large fennel bulb</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>140g risotto rice</li>
            <li>175ml white wine</li>
            <li>550ml hot vegetable stock</li>
            <li>zest 1 lemon</li>
            <li>25g parmesan</li>
            <li>small handful cooked, peeled prawns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop any green leafy fennel fronds and set aside. Cut off the stalk-like fennel top, remove the outer layers and finely chop both. Heat 1 tbsp butter in a frying pan and cook the onion, garlic and chopped fennel until soft but not coloured.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and stir for 1 min. Pour over most of the wine and simmer until evaporated. Add 500ml of the hot stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring between each addition until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice remaining fennel and fry in knob of butter until browned. Add remaining stock and wine and cook until tender.</li>             
            <li>When the rice is cooked, stir in the zest, Parmesan and some seasoning. Take off the heat and set aside, covered, for 2 mins. Serve in bowls, topped with the fennel fronds and cooked fennel, stirring the prawns through if using.</li>
        </ol>
