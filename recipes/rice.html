        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Description. Rice meal is composed of polishing rice bran, and some rice flour. It is the ground by-product of rice milling which means the process of removing the husk and the bran layer. It produces an edible byproduct that is free from impurities.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 medium scallions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots (do not thaw)</li>
            <li>4 cups cold cooked brown or white rice (see Recipe Notes), preferably medium grain</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mince 3 garlic cloves. Thinly slice 2 medium scallions crosswise on a slight diagonal, keeping the white parts separate from the light and dark green parts.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a large wok or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the garlic, scallion whites, and 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. Stir-fry until the carrots and peas are thawed, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups cold cooked rice, breaking up any clumps of rice with your fingers as you add it in. Toss to combine with the peas and carrots. Add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Push the fried rice to one side of the pan. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to the now-empty side of the pan, then crack 2 large eggs into the oil. Scramble into fluffy curds until almost set.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir the eggs into the fried rice, breaking up any large pieces of egg. Drizzle with 3/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil and toss to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and white pepper as needed. Garnish with the reserved scallion greens.</li>
        </ol>
